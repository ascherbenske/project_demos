Purpose: Provide files from some of my Georgia Tech projects for code sampling

Contents:

  isye7406_datamining_project.py - the main project file for my data mining class; analyzed the Student Success Factors dataset from Kaggle
  
  isye7406_datamining_project_eval.py - code for evaluating the models and results of the main project file
  
  practicum_app.py - code provided to the practicum class client for predicting the delay of construction project operationalization
  
  practicum_analysis.py - analyzes and tunes the models used for the practicum client to do delay prediction
  
  project_CDA.py - main project file for computational data analytics class; clusters country interactions to analyze relationships that may not be obvious
